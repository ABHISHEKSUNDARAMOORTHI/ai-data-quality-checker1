# 📊🧠 AI-Powered Data Quality & Anomaly Explainer


## ✨ Overview

This project showcases a highly practical application of **Generative AI** within the data engineering landscape. Imagine an intelligent assistant dedicated to ensuring your data is absolutely sparkling clean! 🧼

This smart tool automatically detects common data quality issues and statistical anomalies. But it doesn't stop there! Thanks to **Google Gemini's Generative AI**, it provides **clear explanations** for *why* an anomaly exists and suggests **actionable steps** to resolve it. No more puzzling over cryptic errors! 🤯 This app is designed to make data cleanup far more efficient and intuitive for data professionals.

## 🚀 Features

* **Effortless Data Upload:** Simply drag and drop your CSV files for quick analysis. 📤
* **Deep Data Profiling:** Get comprehensive data quality reports generated by `ydata-profiling`. This includes insights on missing values, duplicates, unique entries, and more. ✅
* **Smart Anomaly Detection:** Leverages statistical methods and machine learning (like Isolation Forest) to pinpoint subtle outliers and irregularities within your datasets. 🕵️‍♀️
* **AI Explanations on Tap:** Integrates directly with the **Google Gemini API** to provide human-readable explanations for every detected anomaly, even hinting at potential root causes. 🤔
* **Actionable Fixes:** Gemini goes beyond explanation, offering concrete remediation steps. These can include handy Python (Pandas) code snippets or direct SQL commands to help you resolve identified data problems. 🛠️
* **Interactive Web App:** A user-friendly Streamlit dashboard that lets you easily upload data, review comprehensive reports, and interact with AI-generated insights. 🖥️

⚙️ Setup & Installation
Ready to get this project running on your local machine? Follow these straightforward steps!

Prerequisites ✅
Python 3.9+ installed on your system. 🐍
A Google Gemini API Key (you can obtain one for free from Google AI Studio).
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this project to your local machine using Git:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/ABHISHEKSUNDARAMOORTHI/AI-Powered-Data-Quality-Anomaly-Explainer.git
cd AI-Powered-Data-Quality-Anomaly-Explainer
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies:

Bash

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is active, install all the required Python packages:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Secure Your Gemini API Key
Create a file named .env in the root of your project directory.
Add your Gemini API key to this file:
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
(Important: Make sure to replace "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual Gemini API key!)
▶️ Running the Application Locally
Ensure your virtual environment is active.
Navigate to the main project directory in your terminal.
Launch the Streamlit application:
Bash

streamlit run app/app.py
Your default web browser should automatically open to the Streamlit app (typically at http://localhost:8501). 🎉

│   ├── app.py                      # The heart of the Streamlit app
│   ├── data_processor.py           # Handles data loading, profiling, and anomaly detection
│   └── gemini_explainer.py         # Manages Gemini API calls and prompt engineering
├── data/                       # Stores sample data
│   └── sample_data.csv             # Your example dataset
├── .gitignore                  # Specifies files/directories to ignore in Git
├── requirements.txt            # Lists all Python dependencies
└── vercel.json                 # Vercel deployment configuration
🌐 Deployment
This powerful application is deployed live thanks to Vercel! It leverages Vercel's serverless capabilities to host the Streamlit app directly from this GitHub repository.

The vercel.json file, located in the project's root, configures how Vercel builds and serves the Streamlit application, utilizing the @vercel/python builder. Your Gemini API key is securely managed as an environment variable within Vercel's project settings. 🔒
